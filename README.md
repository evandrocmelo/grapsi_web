# GRAPSI WEB - Digital Psychrometric Chart

GRAPSI is an application that calculates the psychrometric properties of moist air and displays them on a chart on the computer screen. 
It can simulate processes such as heating, cooling, adiabatic humidification, and mixing of air flows. 
The program operates over a wide temperature range, from -100 to 372 ºC, and altitudes up to 4,000 meters.
